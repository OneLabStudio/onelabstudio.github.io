<h1>Terms of Service for Android Applications</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 14, 2026</p>

<p>
Welcome to the Android applications (the "Apps" or "Service") provided by
<strong>OneLab Studio</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms")
govern your use of my Apps. Please read them carefully before downloading or using any of my Apps.
</p>

<p>
By downloading, accessing, or using any of my Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms
and my <a href="https://onelabstudio.github.io/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use my Apps.
</p>

<h2>1. License to Use the Apps</h2>
<p>
I grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use my Apps
for your personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.
</p>
<p>
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Apps or included software,
nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the Apps, except as permitted
by law or with my written permission. All intellectual property rights related to the Apps
remain the property of OneLab Studio.
</p>

<h2>2. Age Requirements</h2>
<p>
The Apps are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or the applicable age
of digital consent in your jurisdiction). If you are under this age, you may only use the Apps
with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms.
</p>

<h2>3. App Functionality and Updates</h2>
<p>
I strive to ensure that the Apps are useful and reliable. I reserve the right to modify,
update, or discontinue any part of the Apps at any time.
</p>
<p>
The Apps may store and process personal data as described in the Privacy Policy in order to
provide the Service. You are responsible for keeping your device secure. I recommend that you
do not jailbreak or root your device, as this may compromise security and cause the Apps to
malfunction or stop working.
</p>
<p>
Updates may be required to continue using the Apps. While I do not guarantee that the Apps
will always support every Android version, you agree to accept updates when they are made available.
</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
Some Apps may offer in-app purchases (IAPs), such as unlocking additional features, removing
advertisements, or accessing premium functionality.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All in-app purchases are optional and processed through the Google Play billing system.</li>
    <li>I do not collect or store your payment information.</li>
    <li>Purchased features are available only within the App.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Refunds for in-app purchases are handled in accordance with Google Play’s refund policies.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The Apps may use third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. By using the Apps,
you agree to be bound by the applicable terms of these third parties.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>AdMob (Google)</li>
    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
    <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Internet Connection and Data Charges</h2>
<p>
Some features of the Apps require an active internet connection. I am not responsible for the Apps
not functioning properly if you do not have internet access or if you exceed your data allowance.
</p>
<p>
If you use the Apps over a mobile network, you are responsible for any data or roaming charges
incurred according to your mobile provider’s terms.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, OneLab Studio shall not be liable for any indirect,
incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of or inability to
use the Apps.
</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>
I may terminate or suspend your access to the Apps at any time, without prior notice, if you violate
these Terms or if continued use may cause legal or technical issues.
</p>
<p>
Upon termination, your right to use the Apps will immediately cease, and you must stop using and
uninstall them.
</p>

<h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
<p>
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Romania, without regard
to its conflict of law provisions.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
I reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page and
will take effect when published.
</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
