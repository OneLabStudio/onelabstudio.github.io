<h1>Privacy Policy for OneLab Studio Android Applications</h1>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 31, 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which <strong>OneLab Studio</strong> ("we," "us," or "our")
collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User")
of our Android applications (the "Service" or "Apps"). This policy applies to all Android
applications published by OneLab Studio.
</p>

<p>
By using our Apps, you signify your acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree to this
policy, please do not use our Apps. Your continued use of the Apps following the posting
of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
Our Apps are designed with your privacy in mind. We collect information primarily to
provide and improve the Service, and to ensure its stability and functionality.
</p>

<h2>Information You Provide Voluntarily</h2>
<p>
We do not typically require you to provide personally identifiable information to use
the core features of our Apps. If any feature requires such information, this will be
clearly indicated at the point of collection, and your explicit consent will be obtained.
</p>

<h2>Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data &amp; Device Information)</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Log Data &amp; Crash Reports:</strong>
        In the event of an error or crash, we collect diagnostic information through
        third-party tools such as Firebase Crashlytics. This may include device information,
        operating system version, app configuration, time and date of use, and error stack
        traces. This data is used solely to improve app stability and performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Analytics Data:</strong>
        We use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how our Apps are used, including
        app opens, feature usage, session duration, device type, operating system version,
        and approximate geographic location (such as country). This data is aggregated and
        used to improve the user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advertising ID:</strong>
        If you consent to personalized advertising, our Apps may use your device’s
        Advertising ID (such as the Google Advertising ID) to display relevant ads.
        You can reset or limit this identifier through your device settings.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Collected Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To provide and improve our Services</li>
    <li>To diagnose crashes and fix bugs</li>
    <li>To analyze usage patterns and improve user experience</li>
    <li>To display advertisements (with user consent)</li>
    <li>To ensure app stability and security</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
<p>
Our Apps may use third-party services that collect information to provide their services.
These providers are required to use the information only for the purposes of providing
services to us.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>Google AdMob</li>
    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
    <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Consent and Control (Google Consent Mode V2)</h2>
<p>
We respect your privacy choices and comply with applicable data protection regulations,
including the EU User Consent Policy. Our Apps implement Google Consent Mode V2 to manage
how Google services operate based on your consent.
</p>

<p>
You may be asked to consent to analytics storage, advertising storage, ad user data,
and ad personalization. If you deny consent, services will operate in a limited mode
and non-personalized ads may be shown where applicable.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
Our Apps do not use cookies in the traditional web browser sense. However, third-party SDKs
may use device identifiers or similar technologies. Your consent choices determine how
these technologies are used.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We use commercially reasonable measures to protect information processed by our Apps.
However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and we
cannot guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>
Our Apps may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible
for the content or privacy practices of those sites and encourage you to review their
privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Our Apps are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of
digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from
children.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
page and reflected by an updated revision date.
